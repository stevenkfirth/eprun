Demo - Reading the Output Files
===============================

A successful EnergyPlus simulation run will generate a series of EnergyPlus output files. 

.. code-block:: python
   :lineno-start: 1

   >>> from eprun import runsim
   >>> result=runsim(ep_dir=r'C:\EnergyPlusV9-4-0',
   >>>               input_filepath='1ZoneUncontrolled.idf',
   >>>               epw_filepath='USA_CO_Golden-NREL.724666_TMY3.epw',
   >>>               sim_dir='simulation_results')
   >>> print(type(epresult))
   <class 'eprun.epresult.EPResult'>
   >>> print(list(epresult.files.keys()))      # This prints the output file extensions
   ['audit', 'bnd', 'dxf', 'eio', 'end', 'err', 'eso', 'mdd', 'mtd', 'mtr', 
    'rdd', 'shd', 'csv', 'htm', 'tab', 'txt', 'xml']
   
The EnergyPlus output files are text files and can be read with the Python built-in `open` method.
However the format of the text files is non-standard so additional processing is almost always required.

*eprun* contains the following classes for reading EnergyPlus output files:

* `EPEnd` for reading '.end' files.
* `EPErr` for reading '.err' files.
* `EPEso` for reading '.eso' files.

These classes can be created directly or by using the ``get_[output_file_extension]`` methods of the `EPResult` object.

The simplest output file is the '.end' file which contains a single line of information. 
This is accessed using the `get_end` method which returns a `EPEnd` object instance.

.. code-block:: python
   :lineno-start: 11

   >>> end=epresult.get_end()
   >>> print(type(end))
   <class 'eprun.epend.EPEnd'>
   >>> print(end.line)   # The single line of the file
   EnergyPlus Completed Successfully-- 0 Warning; 0 Severe Errors; Elapsed Time=00hr 00min  2.21sec

A slightly more complex output file is the '.err' file which records an errors encountered during the simulation run.
This is accessed using the `get_err` method which returns a `EPErr` object instance.

.. code-block:: python
   :lineno-start: 16

   >>> err=epresult.get_err()
   >>> print(type(err))
   <class 'eprun.eperr.EPErr'>
   >>> for line in err.lines: print(line, end='')      # Prints all lines in the file

Another output file is the '.eso' file which contains the results of the simulation calculations. 
Instructions on how to view these results is described in the tutorial `Reading the eso Output File`.

Congratulations! You now know how to run an EnergyPlus simulation using the `runsim` function
and how to access the simulation results and output files using the `EPResult` class.
