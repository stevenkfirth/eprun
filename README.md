# eprun

*eprun* is a Python package for running [EnergyPlus] simulations.



## Documentation (recommended)

Please see the [eprun package homepage] for the full documentation.



## What is *eprun*?

*eprun* is a Python package which can be used to run [EnergyPlus] simulations for modelling the energy and environmental performance of buildings. 

*eprun* contains Python functions and classes which can:

* run an [EnergyPlus] simulation within the Python environment
* view the data in [EnergyPlus] output files (such as .end, .err and .eso files)
* create and/or modify [EnergyPlus] input files (such as .idf, .epJSON and .epw files)



## Why use *eprun*?

*eprun* enables [EnergyPlus] to be used entirely within a Python environment. This can be useful for:

* Using Python statements (such as `for` loops) to run multiple simulations for batch processing or parametric analysis
* Analysing the simulation results using Python data analysis tools such as [pandas] and [matplotlib]
* Creating simulation input files from scratch using Python statements
* Modifying simulation input files and weather files directly for setting up multiple simulation runs 
* Collaborating on and version controlling [EnergyPlus] workflows (for example using [GitHub])
* Publishing academic papers and reports based on [EnergyPlus] simulations, with the option to publish the Python code which created the results as part of an Open Science workflow



## Quick Demo

*eprun* uses the [`eprun`] function to run an [EnergyPlus] simulation. 
The code below runs an [EnergyPlus] simulation on an '.idf' input file and an '.epw' weather file.

```python
>>> from eprun import eprun
>>> epresult=eprun(ep_dir='C:\EnergyPlusV9-4-0',
>>>                input_filepath='1ZoneUncontrolled.idf',
>>>                epw_filepath='USA_CO_Golden-NREL.724666_TMY3.epw',
>>>                sim_dir='simulation_results')
>>> print(type(epresult))
```

```
<class 'eprun.epresult.EPResult'>
```



We can see that the simulation was successful by looking at the single line '.end' file, 
one of the output files produced by the simulation run.

```python
>>> print(epresult.get_end().line)
```

```
EnergyPlus Completed Successfully-- 0 Warning; 0 Severe Errors; Elapsed Time=00hr 00min  2.39sec
```



The simulation calculation results are located in the '.eso' file, another of the simulation output files. 
We can see a summary of the interval (hourly) results in the 'RUN PERIOD 1' section of the '.eso' file by using the [`get_interval_summary`] method:

```python
>>> print(epresult.get_eso().get_environment('RUN PERIOD 1').get_interval_summary())
```

```
Starts at 2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00, 8760 periods @ 60 minute intervals
7 - Environment - Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature (C)
47 - ZONE ONE - Zone Total Internal Latent Gain Energy (J)
74 - ZONE ONE - Zone Mean Radiant Temperature (C)
75 - ZONE ONE - Zone Mean Air Temperature (C)
76 - ZONE ONE - Zone Air Heat Balance Surface Convection Rate (W)
77 - ZONE ONE - Zone Air Heat Balance Air Energy Storage Rate (W)
```



The [`plot`] method can be used to create a quick time series plot of the hourly data.
Here the hourly values for the 'ZONE ONE - Zone Mean Air Temperature' variable are shown.

```python
>>> epresult.get_eso().get_environment('RUN PERIOD 1').get_interval_variable(75).plot()
```
