`eprun` is a Python package for running EnergyPlus simulations.



## Documentation (recommended)

Please see the `eprun` package documentation here:

[TO DO ]



## Quick Demo

`eprun` uses the `eprun` function to run an EnergyPlus simulation. 
The code below runs an EnergyPlus simulation on an '.idf' input file and an '.epw' weather file.

```python
>>> from eprun import eprun
>>> epresult=eprun(ep_dir='C:\EnergyPlusV9-4-0',
>>>             input_filepath='1ZoneUncontrolled.idf',
>>>             epw_filepath='USA_CO_Golden-NREL.724666_TMY3.epw',
>>>             sim_dir='my_results')
>>> print(type(epresult))
```

```
eprun.epresult.EPResult
```



We can see that the simulation was successful by looking at the single line '.end' file, 
one of the output files produced by the simulation run.

```python
>>> print(epresult.get_end().line)
```

```
EnergyPlus Completed Successfully-- 0 Warning; 0 Severe Errors; Elapsed Time=00hr 00min  2.39sec
```



The simulation outputs are located in the '.eso' file, another of the simulation output files. 
We can see a summary of the interval (hourly) results in the 'RUN PERIOD 1' section of the '.eso' file by using the `get_interval_summary` method:

```python
>>> print(epresult.get_eso().get_environment('RUN PERIOD 1').get_interval_summary())
```

```
Starts at 2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00, 8760 periods @ 60 minute intervals
7 - Environment - Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature (C)
47 - ZONE ONE - Zone Total Internal Latent Gain Energy (J)
74 - ZONE ONE - Zone Mean Radiant Temperature (C)
75 - ZONE ONE - Zone Mean Air Temperature (C)
76 - ZONE ONE - Zone Air Heat Balance Surface Convection Rate (W)
77 - ZONE ONE - Zone Air Heat Balance Air Energy Storage Rate (W)
```



The `plot` method can be used to create a quick time series plot of the hourly data.
Here the hourly values for the 'ZONE ONE - Zone Mean Air Temperature' variable are shown.

```python
>>> epresult.get_eso().get_environment('RUN PERIOD 1').get_interval_variable(75).plot()
```
